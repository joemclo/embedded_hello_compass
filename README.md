# Experimenting with the STM32F3DISCOVERY microcontroller and the Rust programming language

This repo represents my experimentation with using rust on the F3 microcontroller development board.

## Project Goal
Besides learning the end goal of the project is reading sensors on the board, sending the readings over bluetooth to a computer where they are visualised. 
There parts of the system include:
- Sensor reader on the microcontroller
- Sensor data serialization and transmission from the microcontroller
- Sensor data receiver and deserialiation on the host PC
- Data visualization on the host PC
